NH Police Tweets
----------------

#### This project builds a shiny app that displays the positive/negative and emotional sentiment of New Hampshire police tweets using wordclouds, radar plots, and other visuals.

### You can check out the app at <https://jeremyd.shinyapps.io/Police_Tweets/>

### Instructions for building the shiny app (this requires a twitter developer account):

#### 1) Download the repository and unzip the zipped folder

#### 2) Open the read\_tweets.R file and enter in your twitter keys

#### 3) Run the read\_tweets.R file - this generates the files necessary to run the app

#### 4) Open the app.R file and run it. This should open the app file for local use.
